# Fusion-360-API
Fusion API python scripts

These are API scripts for Fusion 360, feel free to use them as you wish!

They are my first python scripts ever, so they might not be perfectly optimised.

----
wave2line
- Creates a wavy spline in one sketch, and an equally long straight line on an offset construction plane
- Then it lofts the two open profiles
- You can set the lenght and height of the surface, and the wavyness of the spline.

----
wave2wave
- Creates a wavy spline in one sketch, and another wavy spline on an offset construction plane
- Then it lofts the two open profiles, making the loft driven by the direction of the sketches
- You can set the lenght and height of the surface, and the wavyness of the two splines.

----
wave2wave_curved
- Creates a wavy spline in one sketch, and another wavy spline on a perpendicularly offset construction plane
- Then it lofts the two open profiles, making the loft driven by the direction of the sketches
- You can set the lenght and height of the surface, and the wavyness of the two splines.
